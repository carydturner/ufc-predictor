# Project: ufc fight predictor  
# Description: In this project, we seek to use the following data to predict two outcomes. 
The first is to try to predict the outcome of a fight, based on various fighter statistics provided 
in the data set, using logistic regression, the lasso, and ridge regression. The second objective 
is to predict the red fighter's odds based on the same fighter statistics using linear regression, 
the lasso, and ridge.

Data set is from https://www.kaggle.com/mdabbert/ultimate-ufc-dataset
